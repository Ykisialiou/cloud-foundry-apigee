# Cloud Foundry and Apigee Edge Integration

This repository includes code you can use to integrate Apigee Edge with Cloud Foundry (including Pivotal and open source instances). Using this integration, you can proxy your Cloud Foundry apps with proxies hosted on either [Apigee Edge in the cloud](http://docs.apigee.com/api-services/content/what-apigee-edge) or [Edge Microgateway](http://docs.apigee.com/microgateway/latest/overview-edge-microgateway).

For a sample Cloud Foundry apps for testing this integration, see the provided [samples](samples).

Generally, this integration requires:

- An Apigee account. If you don't have one, you can sign up [here](https://login.apigee.com/sign_up)
- The Apigee Service Broker installed on Cloud Foundry. (Instructions are provided for each plan)
- If you're using Edge Microgateway in Cloud Foundry, you'll need to [install](http://docs.apigee.com/microgateway/latest/installing-edge-microgateway) Edge Microgateway locally
